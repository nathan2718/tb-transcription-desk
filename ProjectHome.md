The 2010 [Transcribe Bentham](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/) project at UCL used MediaWiki as the base environment for a distributed, collaborative transcription effort.

Some basic Mediawiki plugins were created to add a zoom-viewer (based on Zoomify)

In additon other third-party plugins and Mediawiki configuration options to enhance the user experience. Details of these are in the accompanying documentation.
